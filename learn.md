# Fixes and Changes in the Project

## 1. **Error Handling for Image Loading**
   - In the `Home.tsx` file, the `onError` handler for the `<img>` tag ensures that a placeholder image (`/placeholder-movie.jpg`) is displayed if the movie poster fails to load. This improves user experience by avoiding broken image links.

## 2. **User Authentication Check**
   - The `Home` component redirects unauthenticated users to the `/auth` page using `useNavigate`. This ensures that only logged-in users can access the home page.

## 3. **Dynamic Time Window for Trending Movies**
   - A state variable `timeWindow` is used to toggle between 'day' and 'week' for fetching trending movies. Buttons allow users to switch between these options dynamically.

## 4. **Carousel Customization**
   - The carousel in the `Home` component is configured with custom dots and autoplay settings to enhance the visual appeal and usability.

## 5. **Category-Based Movie Sections**
   - The `categories` array defines different movie sections (e.g., Trending Movies, Popular Series, Animations, Documentaries) with filters based on `genre_ids`. This modular approach makes it easy to add or modify categories.

## 6. **Protected Routes in App.tsx**
   - The `ProtectedRoute` component ensures that only authenticated users can access certain routes. This is applied to all major pages like `Home`, `MovieDetails`, and `TVSeriesDetails`.

## 7. **Persistent User Session**
   - The `App.tsx` file retrieves the user session from `localStorage` on app initialization and sets it in the `authStore`. This ensures that users remain logged in across sessions.

## 8. **Fallback for Empty Trending Data**
   - If the `trending` array is empty, a fallback message is displayed to inform users that no trending movies are available. This prevents the UI from breaking.

## 9. **Responsive Design**
   - The grid layout in `MovieSection` adapts to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS classes (`grid-cols-2`, `md:grid-cols-4`, `lg:grid-cols-6`).

## 10. **Code Modularity**
   - Components like `MovieSection` and `SearchBar` are reused to maintain a clean and modular codebase. This reduces redundancy and improves maintainability.

These changes collectively enhance the functionality, user experience, and maintainability of the project.
